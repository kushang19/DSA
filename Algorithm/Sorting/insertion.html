    <h1>Insertion Sorting in Javascript</h1>
    <p>
      Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively
      inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a
      sorted portion of the list. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that
      elements with equal values maintain their relative order in the sorted
      output.
      <br />
      Insertion sort is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the
      cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, you
      pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the
      sorted group.
      <br />
      Insertion Sort Algorithm: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm
      that works by building a sorted array one element at a time.<br/> 
      It is considered an ” in-place ” sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn’t require
      any additional memory space beyond the original array.<br/> 
      To achieve insertion sort, follow these steps: We start with second element of the
      array as first element in the array is assumed to be sorted. <br/>
      Compare second element with the first element and check if the second element is
      smaller then swap them. Move to the third element and compare it with the
      second element, then the first element and swap as necessary to put it in
      the correct position among the first three elements. <br/>
      Continue this process, comparing each element with the ones before it and swapping as
      needed to place it in the correct position among the sorted elements.<br/>
      Repeat until the entire array is sorted.
